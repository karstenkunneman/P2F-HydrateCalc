Web Application:
1. Fixed an issue where the input template had the wrong component order
2. Only the temperature (or pressure) and composition is required on input CSV file, and the program will
   automatically guess if no guesses are provided
3. Added some handling of user error to reduce amount of script breaks (still WIP)

Backend:
1. Output CSV will only show different compositions for each point if composition is not uniform across all points
2. If a composition is not defined on an input CSV line, it will now default to the composition of the point above it
3. Improvements to output CSV template
