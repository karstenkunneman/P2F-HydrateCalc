Web app:
	1. Changed the default simulation conditions to provide a more aesthetically pleasing graph
	2. Added a column to the "Full Dataset" download which indicates the gas storage capacity of generated hydrate
	3. Fixed an issue which would break the Minimum Concentration Calculation functionality
	4. Full Dataset download now rounds component concentrations to 2 decimals instead of 4 (reflecting precision
	   in web app)
	5. Default number of points is now standardized to 8
	6. Fixed a bug which would cause an error when checking for max concentration of inhibitors in multipoint
	   calculations

Commandline:
	1. Removed, as all functionality is made redundant by p2f_HydrateCalcLib library

Backend:
	1. Replaced simulation functions with those in the new p2f_HydrateCalcLib library, improving performance and 
	   reducing complexity
	2. Upgraded to Python 3.12 and downgraded to Streamlit 1.40.0 to maintain compatibility
